    'In the Design of Educational Games course at Carnegie Mellon University, Dr. Erik Harpstead uses the set of 30 principles from Koedinger, Booth, and Klahr’s 2013 article Instructional Complexity and the Science to Constrain It. Students are expected to more or less memorize the list, a daunting task that often leads to misconceptions about some of the principles.\n';

    'Our earliest concept was one big game in which the player could turn the principle off and on to feel it’s absence.\n' +
    '\n' +
    'Another idea I paper-prototyped was a “choose your own adventure” style experience in which the player was tasked to teach an alien to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich by making choices that best utilize the principles. This approach piggybacked on both the Quizzing principle and the Application principle by teaching through repeated exposure, similar to how Duolingo teaches vocabulary.\n';
