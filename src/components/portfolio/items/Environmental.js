const process = 'Using the Standford design-thinking framework, we uncovered a surprising number of factors contributing to eye strain. We prototyped solutions in CSS, and I leveraged Internet Explorer’s accessibility tools to test stylesheets for effectiveness of alleviating eye strain.';
const solution = 'We made changes to text, color palette, and the way we render fonts, all to improve legibility. We introduced a “night mode” for nighttime use and wall-boards in dark hospital corridors. Lastly, we standardized best practices for lighting and hardware.';
